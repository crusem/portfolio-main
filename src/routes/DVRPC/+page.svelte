<h2><strong>#1 Behind the Data:</strong> Uncovering the Impact of College Population and Transit Access on Philadelphia's Pedestrian Activity</h2>
<p>
This is the first article in a series of four data bulletins that analyze whether and how different variables affect pedestrian counts.

It was found that college population and transit activity density significantly influence pedestrian counts, confirming that stratifying census tracts based on these factors effectively captures variations in pedestrian activity levels.
