<h1> Research & Data Analytics @ Lime </h1>

<h2>Lime X LAB Mobility Insights Competition</h2>
<p>
In 2024, Lime and the League of American Bicyclists launched the Mobility Insights Competition, aiming to collaborate with two U.S. jurisdictions to tackle transportation issues that increase risks for vulnerable road users. This initiative offered jurisdictions a chance to utilize Lime's extensive datasets, including trip and safety analytics, along with expert guidance from Lime's transportation professionals and the League's policy advisors. The goal was to craft data-driven strategies to enhance road safety, reduce incidents, and create a more inclusive transportation environment for pedestrians, cyclists, and micromobility users.

I worked extensively on the bike lane analysis component of this project, employing a difference-in-differences approach to assess the impact of new bike lanes on road safety and usage.</p> 
<p> <strong>Tools Used:</strong> R, QGIS, and SQL </p>
